# Restart-App-01
 ADVANCED APP DESIGN The main goal of this mini project is to inspire you on what we can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework. 
 COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Appleâ€™s stock user interface library. 
 PARALLAX EFFECT By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect) we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.
